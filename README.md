**FILES:**

Tx_Rx.grc
- a complete LoRa transmision, with no noise, no perpendicular signals.

Gaussian_Noise_Time_Demo.grc
- a demonstration of rms value of gaussian noise, sine wave rms value and the sum of them.

Tx_Rx_Perpendicular_sf.grc
- a transmission with sampling factor perpendicular signals

BER.grc
- A small demonstration of "Err measures" block on Bit Error Couting to make the proper B.E. Rate.
