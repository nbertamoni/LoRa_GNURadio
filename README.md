# LoRa_GNURadio

## This is a LoRa implementation in GNU Radio 3.7

**This implementation was made by EPFL Telecommunication lab and its available also here:**

**FILES:**

Tx_Rx.grc
- A complete LoRa transmision, with no noise, no perpendicular signals.

Gaussian_Noise_Time_Demo.grc
- A demonstration of rms value of gaussian noise, sine wave rms value and the sum of them.

Tx_Rx_Perpendicular_sf.grc
- A transmission with sampling factor perpendicular signals

BER.grc
- A small demonstration of "Err measures" block on Bit Error Couting to make the proper bit error rate. 

Tx_Rx_gaussian_noise.grc
- A transmission with gaussian noise added to the channel.

Tx_Rx_transmission_amplitude.grc
- A transmission showing clear signal amplitude. 1,8pico pico as far as I can see
